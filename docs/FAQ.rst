License
~~~~~~~

boo is licensed under a MIT/BSD style license. The current license is
always `available here`_.

How complete is boo at the present moment? What’s its current status?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Boo is already usable for a large variety of tasks but there still are
lots of things in our todo list.

Performance: since it is statically typed, can I expect a performance equal or close to c# or vb.net?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes.

How different is it from Python?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See Gotchas for Python Users for a summary.

Is it feasable to use boo for building desktop or asp.net applications?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. Boo can already be used to implement WinForms/GTK# applications.
Take a look at the extras/boox folder for an example.

On the asp.net front, thanks to Ian it’s already possible to directly
embed boo code inside asp.net pages, handlers or webservices.
examples/asp.net should give you an idea of how everything works right
now.

(Sharp\|Mono)Develop bindings?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Daniel Grunwald has made great progress on the SharpDevelop front.
Recent versions of SharpDevelop include solution creation in Boo.

As for MonoDevelop, it includes a Boo binding, written by Peter
Johanson, leveraging the parser code written by Daniel Grunwald for the
SharpDevelop binding. It includes Boo project
creation/editing/compiling, as well as an interactive shell with Gtk#
integration. See the monodevelop page for more information on installing
it.

I see references on the site for .NET 1.1 and .NET 2.0, does Boo support .NET 3.0?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.NET 3.0 is actually just an update to the framework and not to the CLR
or any of the “official” languages. As such, it should be supported by
any .NET-2.0-supporting language, such as Boo.

Also, Boo release .78 is the last version of Boo that will support .NET
1.1.

What’s a good way to get started with Boo (editors/IDEs)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fire up a console and check out booish - a built-in editor to check out
the basics. Then grab a copy of Sharpdevelop or monodevelop to dive into
developing with Boo.

What do people use for building ‘real’ Boo applications?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Windows, Sharpdevelop is the most robust and stable IDE for
developing BOO applications. Linux and Mac users develop with their
favorite text editor. The monodevelop team are hard at work developing a
more professional development environment that will support Boo along
with other .NET languages.

When will version 1.0 be available?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Boo is written in Boo it will be dubbed version 1.0.
