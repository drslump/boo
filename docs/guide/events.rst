Events
======

What's that timmy? You're exposing your API to someone else, and they want convient handy-dandy events?! No problem! As with everything in Boo, its dead simple to get up and running within moments with the ``event`` keyword::

	import System

	class Clicker:
		event Clicked as EventHandler
		def RaiseClick():
			Clicked(self, null)

Aww, yeah! Now you can use it like any other event!::

	p = Clicker()
	p.Clicked += def(sender, args):
		print "Tah CLICKED!"
	p.RaiseClick()
	(it prints out "Tah CLICKED!" if you're curious)

By now you're probably wondering what "EventHandler" is. In .NET, they are commonly referred to as delegates, a type of event that can be subscribed to by multiple functions, as long as each function has the same method signature as the delegate. An "event" is a special kind of delegate that has one important rule:

	It can't be called from outside its declaring class.

This keeps sneaky coders from invoking an event from somewhere else and potentially messing things up. Leaky boats are bad!

Suppose, though, you want a ham sandwich on rye, or you want to expose a unique kind of event that has its own unique arguments. Here's another code sample to whet your apetite::

	import System

	class Sandwich:
		//object - sandwich eaten.
		//bool - if there are leftovers.
		event Eaten as callable(object, bool)
		//The two codes of line below are
		//the equivilent of the one line of code above!
		event Eating as EatingEvent
		//object -- sandwiich being eaten.
		//string -- the kind of sammich being eaten.
		callable EatingEvent(sammich as object, type as string)

		def Eat():
			Eating(self, "Turkey sammich.")
			Eaten(self, false)

	turkeyAndSwiss = Sandwich()
	turkeyAndSwiss.Eating += def(obj, sammich):
		print "You're eating a $sammich! It must be good."
	turkeyAndSwiss.Eaten += def(obj, leftovers):
		print "You", ("didn't leave me anything?!","left leftovers! How sweet!")[leftovers]
	turkeyAndSwiss.Eat()
