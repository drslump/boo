Slicing
=======

A slicing operation is a simple way to extract a range of elements from a container. The boo compiler supports native slicing operations on lists, arrays and strings.

.. note:: Support for user defined slicing operations is planned but currently not implemented.

General Syntax
--------------

A slicing operation is applied to a container through the following syntax::

    range = container[<firstIndexWanted> : <firstIndexNotWanted> : <step>]

 - When **firstIndexWanted** is omitted it is assumed to be 0.
 - When **firstIndexNotWanted** is omitted it is assumed to be equals to ``len(container)``.
 - When **step** is omitted it is assumed to be 1.


List Slicing
------------

::

    l = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    assert l[0] == 1
    assert l[0:1] == [1]
    assert l[0:2] == [1, 2]
    assert l[1:3] == [2, 3]
    assert l[:] == [1, 2, 3, 4]  // easy way to clone a list


Array Slicing
-------------

::

    a = (1, 2, 3, 4)
    assert a[0:1] == (1,)
    assert a[:3] == (1, 2, 3)
    assert a[:2] == (1, 2)
    #assert a[::2] == (1, 3)      #Slicing step not implemented yet
    #assert a[-2:-1:-1] == (4, 3) #ditto


String Slicing
--------------

::

    s = "bamboo"
    assert "b" == s[0:1]
    assert "boo" == s[3:]
    assert "bo" == s[3:-1]


Differences Between Collection Types
------------------------------------

Consider the following example::

    print([1, 2, 3].GetType())      # will print "Boo.Lang.List"
    print((4, 5, 6).GetType())      # will print "System.Int32[]"
    print(("1", "2", 3).GetType())  # will print "System.Object[]"
    print(("a", "b").GetType())     # will print "System.String[]"
    print(["foo", "bar"].GetType()) # will print "Boo.Lang.List"

You must specify a parameter is a sliceable type when using it with methods::

    // This code will NOT compile
    class Test:
        def example(itens):
            i = 0
            itensLen = len(itens)
            while i < itensLen:
                print (itens[i])
                ++i
     
    t = Test()
    t.example([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

the above code will result on compile time error "The type 'System.Object' does not support splicing". This is because the boo compiler cannot predict that you want to pass a collection to the method, and since the type object is neither a collection or array, we got the error. To handle that, explicitly tell the compiler that you will pass a collection to the method::

    // This code WILL compile
    import System.Collections
     
    class Test:
        def example(itens as IList):
            i = 0
            itensLen = len(itens)
            while i < itensLen:
                print (itens[i])
                ++i
    t = Test()
    t.example([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
