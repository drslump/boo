Regular Expressions
===================

Boo has built-in support for regular expression literals. You surround the regular expression with ``/regex/``, or ``@/regex/`` for more complex expressions that contain whitespace.

.. note:: Boo even has an ``=~`` operator like Perl. 

Here are some samples of using regular expressions in boo::

    //pattern matching using perl's match operator (=~)
    samplestring = "Here is foo"
    if samplestring =~ /foo/:
           print "it's a match"

    //sample regex object
    re = /foo(bar)/
    print re.GetType() //-> System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex

    //split a line on spaces:
    words = @/ /.Split(samplestring)  //you can also use \s for any type of whitespace
    print join(words, ",")

    //similar example with unpacking
    s = "First Last"
    first, last = @/ /.Split(s)

    //another way to do matching without =~
    m = /abc/.Match("123abc456")
    if m.Success:
          print "Found match at position:", m.Index
       print "Matched text:", m.ToString()

    //more complex example with named groups
    s = """
    Joe Jackson
    131 W. 5th Street
    New York, NY  10023
    """

    r = /(?<=\n)\s*(?<city>[^\n]+)\s*,\s*(?<state>\w+)\s+(?<zip>\d{5}(-\d{4})?).*$/.Match(s)

    print r.Groups["city"]
    print r.Groups["state"]
    print r.Groups["zip"]

    //just for reference, the match operator (=~) works with regular strings, too:
    if samplestring =~ "foo":
            print "it matches"

    //the "not match" operator (!~) has not been implemented yet, but you
    //can simply prefix the expression with "not":
    if not samplestring =~ /badfoo/:
           print "no match"


Specifying regex options
------------------------

One limitation of using built-in support for regular expressions is that you can't use non-standard regex options like regex compiled.

Actually there is a way to use the ignore case option. Add a (?i) to the beginnning of your regex pattern like so::

    pattern = /(?i)google/
    print "google" =~ pattern
    print "Google" =~ pattern

But in other cases you may want to just use the .NET Regex class explicitly::

    import System.Text.RegularExpressions

    samplestring = "Here is foo"
    re = Regex("FOO", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase | RegexOptions.Compiled)

    //one way:
    if samplestring =~ re:
       print "we matched"

    //another using Match
    if re.IsMatch(samplestring):
     print "we matched"



Regex Replace method
--------------------

This would be an equivalent to using perl's switch/replace statement: ``s/foo/bar/g``::

    import System.Text.RegularExpressions

    text = "four score and seven years ago"
    print text

    //replace each word with "X"
    t2 = /\w+/.Replace(text, "X")
    print t2 //-> X X X X X X

    //replace only the first occurence of a word with X,
     // starting after the 15th character:
    t3 = /\w+/.Replace(text, "X", 1, 15)
    print t3 //-> four score and X years ago

    //use a closure (or a regular method) to capitalize each word:
    t4 = /\w+/.Replace(text) do (m as Match):
        s = m.ToString()
        if System.Char.IsLower(s[0]): //built-in char type will be added soon
             return System.Char.ToUpper(s[0]) + s[1:]
        return s
    print t4 //-> Four Score And Seven Years Ago


    //Back References are supported too! using the dollar sign
    phonenumber = "5551234567"
    phonenumber = /(\d{3})(\d{3})(\d{4})/.Replace(phonenumber, "($1) $2-$3")
    print phonenumber //-> (555) 123-4567



regex primitive type
--------------------

Also note, Boo has a built-in primitive type called ``regex`` (lowercase) that means the same thing as the .NET Regex class. So you can do for example::

    import System.Text.RegularExpressions

    re = /foo(bar)/

    if re isa regex:
        print "re is a regular expression"

    //or declare the type explicitly:
    re2 as regex = /foo(bar)/
    print re2 isa regex

    //using the regex primitive constructor
    //(You'll need an import statement for RegexOptions)
    re3 = regex("FOO", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase | RegexOptions.Compiled)
    print re3 isa regex
