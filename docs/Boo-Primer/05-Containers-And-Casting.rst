Containers and Casting
======================

Lists
-----

.. note:: **List** - A linked list that can hold a variable amount of objects.

``Lists`` are mutable, which means that the ``List`` can be changed, as
well as its children.

lists
~~~~~

::

    print([0, 'alpha', 4.5, char('d')])
    print List('abcdefghij')
    l = List(range(5))
    print l
    l[2] = 5
    print l
    l[3] = 'banana'
    print l
    l.Add(100.1)
    print l
    l.Remove(1)
    print l
    for item in l:
        print item

    // Output: 
    // [0, alpha, 4.5, d]
    // [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j]
    // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    // [0, 1, 5, 3, 4]
    // [0, 1, 5, 'banana', 4]
    // [0, 1, 5, 'banana', 4, 100.1]
    // [0, 5, 'banana', 4, 100.1]
    // 0
    // 5
    // 'banana'
    // 4
    // 100.1

As you can see, ``Lists`` are very flexible, which is very handy.

``Lists`` can be defined two ways: 1. by using brackets [] 2. by
creating a new ``List`` wrapping an ``IEnumerator``, or an ``array``.

Slicing
-------

Slicing is quite simple, and can be done to ``strings``, ``Lists``, and
``arrays``.

It goes in the form ``var[start:end]``. both start and end are optional,
and must be integers, even negative integers.

To just get one child, use the form ``var[position]``. It will return a
``char`` for a ``string``, an ``object`` for a ``List``, or the
specified type for an ``array``.

Slicing counts up from the number 0, so 0 would be the 1st value, 1
would be the 2nd, and so on.

::

    list = List(range(10))
    print list
    print list[:5]    // first 5
    print list[2:5]   // starting with 2nd, go up to but not including the 5
    print list[5:]    // everything past the 5th
    print list[:-2]   // everything up to the 2nd to last
    print list[-4:-2] // starting with the 4th to last, go up to 2nd to last
    print list[5]     // the 6th
    print list[-8]    // the 8th from last
    print '---'
    str = 'abcdefghij'
    print str
    print str[:5]     // first 5
    print str[2:5]    // starting with 3rd, go up to but not including the 6th
    print str[5:]     // everything past the 6th
    print str[:-2]    // everything before the 2nd to last
    print str[-4:-2]  // starting with the 4th to last, to before the 2nd to last
    print str[5]      // the 6th
    print str[-8]     // the 8th from last

    // Output
    // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    // [2, 3, 4]
    // [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    // [6, 7]
    // 5
    // 2
    // ---
    // abcdefghij
    // abcde
    // cde
    // fghij
    // abcdefgh
    // gh
    // f
    // c

I hope you get the idea. Slicing is very powerful, as it allows you to
express what you need in a minimal amount of space, while still being
readable.

Arrays
------

.. note:: **Array** - Arrays are simple objects that hold equally-sized 
          data elements, generally of the same data type.

``Arrays``, unlike ``Lists``, cannot change their size. They can still
be sliced, just not added on to. ``Arrays`` can be defined three ways:
1. by using parentheses () 1. If you have 0 members, it’s declared:
``(,)`` 2. If you have 1 member, it’s declared: ``(member,)`` 3. If you
have 2 or more members, it’s declared: ``(one, two)`` 2. by creating a
new ``array`` wrapping an ``IEnumerator``, or an ``List``. 3. by
creating a blank ``array`` with a specified size: ``array(type, size)``

arrays
~~~~~~

::

    print((0, 'alpha', 4.5, char('d')))
    print array('abcdefghij')
    l = array(range(5))
    print l
    l[2] = 5
    print l
    l[3] = 'banana'

    // Output
    // (0, alpha, 4.5, d)
    // (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j)
    // (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
    // (0, 1, 5, 3, 4)
    // ERROR: Cannot convert 'System.String' to 'System.Int32'.

``Arrays``, unlike ``Lists``, do not necessarily group ``objects``. They
can group any type, in the case of ``array(range(5))``, it made an
``array`` of ``ints``.


List to Array Conversion
------------------------

If you create a ``List`` of ``ints`` and want to turn it into an
``array``, you have to explicitly state that the ``List`` contains
``ints``.

list to array conversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    list = []
    for i in range(5):
        list.Add(i)
        print list
    a = array(int, list)
    for a_s in a:
        print a_s
    a[2] += 5
    print a
    list[2] += 5
    print list[2]

    // Output
    // [0]
    // [0, 1]
    // [0, 1, 2]
    // [0, 1, 2, 3]
    // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    // (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
    // (0, 1, 7, 3, 4)
    // ERROR: Operator '+' cannot be used with a left-hand side of type 'System.Object' and a right-hand side of type 'System.Int32'

This didn’t work, because the List still gives out ``objects`` instead
of ``ints``, even though it only holds ``ints``.

Casting
-------

.. note:: **Typecast** - The conversion of a variable’s data type to another 
          data type to bypass some restrictions imposed on datatypes.

To get around a list storing only ``objects``, you can
``cast an object`` individually to what its type really is, then play
with it like it should be.

Granted, if you cast to something that is improper, say a ``string`` to
an ``int``, Boo will emit an error. There are two ways to cast an object
as another data type. 1. using ``var as <type>`` 2. using
``var cast <type>``

casting example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    list = List(range(5))
    print list
    for item in list:
        print ((item cast int) * 5)
    print '---'
    for item as int in list:
        print item * item

    // Output
    // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    // 0
    // 5
    // 10
    // 15
    // 20
    // ---
    // 0
    // 1
    // 4
    // 9
    // 16

.. note:: Try not to cast too much. If you are constantly cast-ing, think if 
          there is a better way to write the code.

.. note:: **Generics** - Generics, which has been part of the .NET Framework since
          2.0, will allow you to create a List with a specified data type as its
          base. So there is a way to not have to cast a List’s items every time.

Hashes
------

.. note:: **Hash** - A ``List`` in which the indices may be ``objects``, not just 
          sequential integers in a fixed range.

``Hashes`` are also called “dictionaries” in some other languages.
``Hashes`` are very similar to ``Lists``, except that the key in which
to set values can be an ``object``, though usually an ``int`` or a
``string``. ``Hashes`` can be defined two common ways: 1. by using
braces {} 2. by creating a new ``Hash`` wrapping an ``IEnumerator``, or
an ``IDictionary``.

hash example
~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    hash = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'monkey': 3, 42: 'the answer'}
    print hash['a']
    print hash[42]
    print '---'
    for item in hash:
        print item.Key, '=>', item.Value

    # the same hash can be created from a list like this :
    ll = [ ('a',1), ('b',2), ('monkey',3), (42, "the answer") ]
    hash = Hash(ll)

    // Output
    // 1
    // the answer
    // ---
    // a => 1
    // b => 2
    // monkey => 3
    // 42 => the answer

Exercises
---------

1. Produce a List containing the fibonacci sequence that has 1000 values
   in it. (See if you can do it in 4 lines)
