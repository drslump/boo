Flow control and Loops
======================

For Loop
--------

.. note:: **For loop** - A loop whose body gets obeyed once for each
          item in a sequence.

A ``for`` loop in Boo is not like the ``for`` loop in languages like C
and C#. It is more similar to a ``foreach``.

The most common usage for a ``for`` loop is in conjunction with the
``range`` function.

The ``range`` function creates an enumerator which yields numbers.

The ``join`` function in this case, will create a string from an
enumerator.

join and range example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    join(range(5))         // Output: 0 1 2 3 4
    join(range(3, 7))      // Output: 3 4 5 6
    join(range(0, 10, 2))  // Output: 0 2 4 6 8

``range`` can be called 3 ways:

-  ``range(end)``
-  ``range(start, end)``
-  ``range(start, end, step)``

To be used in a ``for`` loop is quite easy.

for loop
~~~~~~~~

::

    for i in range(5):
        print i

    // Output: 0
    //         1
    //         2
    //         3
    //         4

.. note:: **Practically as fast as C#’s** - The ``range`` function does not create
          an array holding all the values called, instead it is an
          ``IEnumerator``, that will quickly generate the numbers you need.

While Loop
----------

.. note:: **While loop** - A structure in a computer program that
          allows a sequence of instructions to be repeated while some condition
          remains true.

The ``while`` loop is very similar to an ``if`` statement, except that
it will repeat itself as long as its condition is true.

while loop
~~~~~~~~~~

::

    i = 0
    while i < 5:
        print i
        i += 1

    // Output: 0
    //         1
    //         2
    //         3
    //         4

In case you didn’t guess, ``i += 1`` adds 1 to ``i``.

Continue Keyword
----------------

.. note:: **Continue keyword** - A keyword used to resume program execution at the
          end of the current loop.

The ``continue`` keyword is used when looping. It will cause the
position of the code to return to the start of the loop (as long as the
condition still holds).

continue statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    for i in range(10):
        continue if i % 2 == 0
        print i

    // Output: 1
    //         3
    //         5
    //         7
    //         9

This skips the ``print`` part of this loop whenever ``i`` is even,
causing only the odds to be printed out.

The ``i % 2`` actually takes the remainder of ``i`` / 2, and checks it
against 0.

While-Break-Unless Loop
-----------------------

the ``while-break-unless`` loop is very similar to other languages
``do-while`` statement.

while-break-unless loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    i = 10
    while true:
        print i
        i -= 1
        break unless i < 10 and i > 5

    // Output: 10
    //         9
    //         8
    //         7
    //         6
    //         5

Normally, this would be a simple while loop.

This is a good method of doing things if you want to accomplish
something at least once or have the loop set itself up.

Pass Keyword
------------

The ``pass`` keyword is useful if you don’t want to accomplish anything
when defining a code block.

pass statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    while true:
        pass //Wait for keyboard interrupt (ctrl-C) to close program.

Exercises
---------

1. print out all the numbers from 10 to 1.
2. print out all the squares from 1 to 100.
